## About

This is a fork of the [Series Seed Documents](https://github.com/seriesseed/equity/). The documents have been converted from Markdown to HTML for quick use on https://inkdit.com. The mardown versions work well for copy and paste as well but we've taken the extra step of adding the Inkdit placeholders for the signing lines.

For information about the Series Seed Documents, check out the [readme for the original repository](https://github.com/seriesseed/equity/blob/master/README.md)
