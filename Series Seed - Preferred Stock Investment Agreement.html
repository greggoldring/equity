<p>Except as specified in Section 1.2.2, any term of this Agreement may be amended, terminated or waived (either generally or in a particular instance and either retroactively or prospectively) only with the written consent of the Company and the Purchasers holding a majority of the then-outstanding shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock (or Common Stock issued on conversion thereof); provided, however, that any amendment to Section 7.1(a) or Section 7.1(c) shall also require the additional written consent of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Company&rsquo;s Common Stock then held by all of the Common Control Holders. Any amendment or waiver effected in accordance with this Section 8.8 shall be binding upon the Purchasers, the Key Holders, each transferee of the shares of Series Seed Preferred Stock (or the Common Stock issuable upon conversion thereof) or Common Stock from a Purchaser or Key Holders, as applicable, and each future holder of all such securities, and the Company.</p>

<p>No delay or omission to exercise any right, power or remedy accruing to any party under this Agreement, upon any breach or default of any other party under this Agreement, shall impair any such right, power or remedy of such non-breaching or non-defaulting party nor shall it be construed to be a waiver of any such breach or default, or an acquiescence therein, or of or in any similar breach or default thereafter occurring; nor shall any waiver of any single breach or default be deemed a waiver of any other breach or default theretofore or thereafter occurring. Any waiver, permit, consent or approval of any kind or character on the part of any party of any breach or default under this Agreement, or any waiver on the part of any party of any provisions or conditions of this Agreement, must be in writing and shall be effective only to the extent specifically set forth in such writing.
